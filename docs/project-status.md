## Technical Debt

1. **Refactoring Needs**:
   - ✅ Fixed MediaSelector component props typing
   - ⏳ Some components are still too large and should be broken down
   - ⏳ Further consolidate duplicate code in service files

2. **Performance Optimization**:
   - ⏳ Implement virtualization for long lists
   - ⏳ Further optimize image loading with lazy loading
   - ⏳ Add proper caching strategies

3. **Testing**:
   - ❌ No automated tests implemented yet
   - ❌ Need unit tests for critical components
   - ❌ Need integration tests for main user flows

## Firebase Setup Instructions

1. **Create Firebase Project**:
   - Go to Firebase Console (https://console.firebase.google.com/)
   - Create a new project with your preferred name
   - Enable Google Analytics if needed

2. **Setup Storage**:
   - In Firebase console, go to "Storage" in the left sidebar
   - Click "Get started" and follow the setup wizard
   - Choose a location for your data

3. **Create Storage Folders**:
   - Create the following folders in Firebase Storage:
     - `/images` - For general images
     - `/images/posts` - For blog post images
     - `/images/projects` - For project images
     - `/images/achievements` - For achievement images
     - `/images/publications` - For publication images
     - `/files` - For downloadable files

4. **Setup Storage Rules**:
   - Go to "Rules" tab in Storage
   - Update rules to allow read access to anyone and write access to authenticated users:
   ```
   rules_version = '2';
   service firebase.storage {
     match /b/{bucket}/o {
       match /{allPaths=**} {
         allow read: if true;
         allow write: if request.auth != null;
       }
     }
   }
   ```

5. **Get Firebase Configuration**:
   - Go to Project Settings (gear icon in the sidebar)
   - Scroll down to "Your apps" section
   - Click on the web app icon (</>) to register a web app
   - Follow the registration steps
   - Copy the firebaseConfig object from the provided code snippet

6. **Update Firebase Configuration in Your App**:
   - Update the configuration in `src/lib/firebase.ts` with your details:
   ```javascript
   const firebaseConfig = {
     apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
     authDomain: "YOUR_AUTH_DOMAIN",
     projectId: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID",
     storageBucket: "YOUR_STORAGE_BUCKET",
     messagingSenderId: "YOUR_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID",
     appId: "YOUR_APP_ID",
     measurementId: "YOUR_MEASUREMENT_ID"
   };
   ```

## Supabase Database Setup

1. **Create Tables**:
   - Execute the SQL script provided in `public/supabase-setup.sql` in your Supabase SQL editor
   - This will create all necessary tables with proper relationships

2. **Update Row Level Security Policies**:
   - Modify the admin access policies in the SQL script to use your actual admin email
   - Re-run those specific policy creation statements

3. **Initialize Basic Data**:
   - Consider adding some initial data to your tables for testing

## Next Steps (Priority Order)

   - Add course detail view
   - Implement enrollment flow for both free and paid courses

2. Enhance file management:
   - Add file download tracking and statistics
   - Improve file categorization UX

3. Performance optimizations:
   - Implement code splitting for large components
   - Add lazy loading for images and heavy components

4. Prepare for deployment:
